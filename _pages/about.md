I am currently a Ph.D. student of the Department of Computing, [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/) (PolyU), under the supervision of [Prof. Qing Li](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csqli/) and [Dr. Wenqi Fan](https://wenqifan03.github.io/). Before joining the PolyU, I received both a Masterâ€™s degree (MPhil in Engineering) and a Bachelorâ€™s degree (B.Eng. (Hons) in Electrical Engineering) from the University of Sydney in 2023 and 2020, respectively. My research interest covers Recommender Systems, Natural Language Processing, and Deep Reinforcement Learning. I am always welcoming collaboration from solid partners.
